# IoT-Based-Voice-Controlled-FM-Radio
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with everyday 
objects. This project presents the design and implementation of an IoT-based voice
controlled mechanism for an FM radio receiver. The proposed system integrates the 
hardware and software components that enable the users to interact with the radio 
receiver using voice commands. The system consists of an Arduino microcontroller 
board, FM receiver module, a speaker, and a Wi-Fi module for connecting to the 
internet. Google Assistant is used as a voice assistant to control the radio receiver 
through voice commands. The voice commands are processed through the Google 
Assistant API, which sends the commands to the Arduino board. The designed system 
provides various features such as volume control, station selection, and tuning. The 
users can control the radio using simple voice commands, such as "Hey Google, 
activate turn the radio on," "Hey Google, activate set the radio station to Hit FM," and 
"Hey Google, activate set the radio volume to 90." The result shows that the proposed 
system is effective and efficient in controlling the radio receivers’ volume and 
channels using voice commands. The system provides a hands-free and intuitive way 
of controlling the radio, which is especially useful for people with physical 
disabilities. This project contributes to the IoT-based radio industry by providing a 
practical solution for voice-controlled FM radios using Arduino and Google Assistant. 
The proposed system can be extended to support other voice assistants and can be 
applied in various IoT-based applications.
